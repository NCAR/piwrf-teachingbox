## FAQ

### How do I run Pi-WRF locally or as an instance?

Pi-WRF can be run as an instance (where results are not saved) on your 
local machine or on a Raspberry Pi. To run locally, clone (download) the 
NCAR/pi-wrf repository using the green Code button on GitHub. The 
instructions are shown on the Pi-WRF GitHub 
page. By cloning the repo, users can make changes to the Jupyter notebook 
and even change model settings.
The instructions can be found in the first teaching box or at [https://github.com/NCAR/pi-wrf](https://github.com/NCAR/pi-wrf).


### What is GitHub and why is this project primarily distributed through 
it?

GitHub is a repository-hosting service that helps teams and the community 
manage software development projects. Many of today's technology 
companies, universities, and developers use GitHub as part of their 
everyday workflow. Because this Pi-WRF teaching box and Pi-WRF modeling 
project is a community developed project, we have hosted it on GitHub to 
allow 
users to contribute to the project and access the source code. 
GitHub has a 
wonderful page of resources for teachers at 
[https://education.github.com/teachers](https://education.github.com/teachers).

### How can I contribute my own content?

Do you have a lesson, concept, or activity that you are excited about? We 
are always seeking for contributions from teachers, students,and 
university faculty. You may email your submission to agbeli@ucar.edu, or 
fork the repo and submit a pull request for review, feedback, and 
acceptance. Once your teaching box is accepted we will add it to the 
Pi-WRF teaching box page, and acknowledge your contribution. Your 
contribution will make it 
possible for other educators and students to learn about weather, 
computing, and modeling in creative new ways. Once your contribution is 
officially acknowledged, you will be given credit; in other words, your 
name and 
institution will be added to the Pi-WRF website.

### What hardware will I need to run Pi-WRF?
Raspberry Pi 3+ or higher, with monitor and keyboard. You will have to get 
a new SD card and install the Raspbian operating system on it. Directions 
for setting up a Raspberry Pi and installing Raspbian can be found in the 
first 
teaching box.


### How do I provide feedback and ideas?

If you notice technical glitches, or have input on how we can improve our 
software, you may submit an issue directly to our GitHub page at 
[https://github.com/NCAR/pi-wrf/issues](https://github.com/NCAR/pi-wrf/issues).

We would also like to invite you to take our online survey by clicking the 
link below. Your input will help us understand how you use technology in 
the classroom, and how we better encourage the community to contribute 
content to the teaching boxes.
