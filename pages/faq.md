## FAQ

### How do I run Pi-WRF as a local instance?

Pi-WRF can be run as an instance (where results are not saved) on your 
local machine or on a Raspberry Pi. To run locally, clone (download) the 
NCAR/pi-wrf repository using the green Code button on GitHub. The 
instructions are shown on the Pi-WRF GitHub 
page. By cloning the repo, users can make changes to the Jupyter notebook 
and even change model settings.
The instructions can be found in the first teaching box or at [https://github.com/NCAR/pi-wrf](https://github.com/NCAR/pi-wrf).


### What is GitHub, and why is this project primarily distributed through 
it?

GitHub is a repository-hosting service that helps teams and the community 
manage software development projects. Many of today's technology 
companies, universities, and developers use GitHub as part of their 
everyday workflow. The Pi-WRF teaching box project and the Pi-WRF modeling 
project are community-developed projects; as described above, this type of 
project makes up the majority of GitHub projects. Therefore, the Pi-WRF 
projects are hosted on GitHub; this creates a simple interface for 
contributing to the projects and accessing the source code. In addition, 
there are many official GitHub-related resources for teachers. These 
resources can help teachers incorporate GitHub and similar technologies 
into their teaching curricula. You can access these resources (and 
information about them) at
[https://education.github.com/teachers](https://education.github.com/teachers).

### How can I contribute my own content?

Do you have a lesson, concept, or activity that you are excited about? We 
are always seeking for contributions from teachers, students, and 
university faculty. You may email your submission to agbeli@ucar.edu; you 
can also send a submission as a GitHub pull request. To provide a 
submission as a GitHub pull request, fork the GitHub repo, then make the 
changes associated with your submission to the fork. You can then create a 
pull request from the fork; you will receive messages from GitHub about 
review about review, feedback, and acceptance of your submission. Once 
your teaching box is accepted, we will add it 
to the Pi-WRF teaching box page, and acknowledge your contribution. 
Creativity is a very important aspect of any curriculum. By contributing 
to this project, you are helping to boost educators' and students' 
creativity in weather, computing, and modeling curricula. In addition, 
once your contribution is 
officially acknowledged, you will be given credit; in other words, your 
name and 
institution will be added to the Pi-WRF website. This is an excellent 
method to show support for the importance of creativity in science 
curricula.

### What hardware will I need to run Pi-WRF?
You will need a Raspberry Pi 3+, or newer model of Raspberry Pi, as well 
as a compatible monitor and keyboard. In addition, you will need a new SD 
card, and you will need to install the Raspbian operating system on this 
SD card. Directions 
for setting up a Raspberry Pi and installing Raspbian can be found in the 
first 
teaching box.


### How do I provide feedback and ideas?

If you notice technical glitches, or have input on how we can improve our 
software, you may submit an issue directly to our GitHub page at 
[https://github.com/NCAR/pi-wrf/issues](https://github.com/NCAR/pi-wrf/issues).

In addition, we encourage you to provide feedback about your use of 
technology in the classroom. If you are interested, please click the link
