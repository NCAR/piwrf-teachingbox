## Pi-WRF and NGSS
<br/>
<img src="assets/ngss_logo.png" align="right" alt="NGSS 3 Dimension Learning">
The concept of weather and climate cuts across most science disciplines; 
this makes Pi-WRF a natural fit for NGSS. 

Pi-WRF is very proud to build our teaching boxes around the NGSS 
performance expectations and 3-D learning approach. This approach gives 
educators the flexibility to connect the idea of weather forecasting and 
exploration to students’ interest and life experiences. As you 
may know, there are many 
interesting and intricate relationships between the weather, climate and 
other science domains. The Pi-WRF teaching boxes, as well as other Pi-WRF 
activities, are designed around the learning approach, which develops 
students' coherent understanding of these relationships.

One of the main features of the Pi-WRF application is an interface 
that allows for integration 
and analysis of weather data, alongside other environmental data such as 
the 
amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. While the application 
provides 
real and ideal weather data that teachers can use to analyze and answer 
several questions, it also includes libraries that support the analysis of 
structured data that exist in csv, xlsx, netcdf, and other tabular forms. 
As such, educators can collect data about different events related to 
weather, and then analyze them, either independently or in conjunction 
with 
weather data using Pi-WRF.

Using Pi-WRF, educators can introduce students to the concepts of weather, 
weather simulation/modeling, map reading, data analysis/visualization, 
and communication of scientific findings.

### Overview of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are designed to set expectations for the skills and knowledge K-12 students should be able to apply across different science disciplines. NGSS adopts a research-based approach to K-12 science education that affords educators the flexibility to design learning experiences that connect science to students’ interests and their everyday experiences. 

NGSS promotes a three-dimensional approach (3-D learning) to K-12 science 
learning that includes: (a) Crosscutting Concepts, (b) Science and 
Engineering Practices, and (c) Disciplinary Core Ideas. The three 
dimensions are integral components of every NGSS standard; they work 
together in order to allow K-12 students to develop a 
rich understanding of science.

A brief overview of the NGSS 3-D learning components is provided below 
(more information can be found on the NGSS [official 
website](https://www.nextgenscience.org)).

**Practices:** NGSS practices describe the real-world behaviors and engineering techniques that scientists adopt as they investigate and develop theories about the world around them. Examples include engineering design, scientific inquiry, problem solving, and computational thinking.

**Crosscutting Concepts:** These are bodies of knowledge and practices 
that have application across all domains of science; they help students 
develop a coherent view of the world. Examples include Measurement, 
Energy/Matter, Systems, Structure, and Function. 

**Disciplinary Core Ideas:** These are science-related content elements 
and activities that have broad implications 
across different fields, and are related to students’ real life 
experiences. NGSS emphasizes that a core idea should meet at least two of the following four criteria:

1. Have broad importance across multiple science and engineering disciplines.
1. Be connected to students’ interest and real life experiences.
1. Can be taught and learned across multiple grades with increasing depth and breadth.
1. Provide a key tool for investigating more complex ideas and solving problems.

Disciplinary core ideas are grouped into four domains: (1) Physical sciences, (2) Earth and space sciences, (3) Life sciences, and (4) Engineering, technology, and application of science. 

While the concept of weather reasearch and forecasting is most related to 
the earth and space sciences domain, its impacts cut across all four 
domains identified above.

The next sections provide an overview of NGSS's 3-D learning approach, 
followed by some performance expectations that can be addressed using Pi-WRF at the middle and high school levels.

> **Note:**

Since the concept and implication of weather cuts across most disciplines, we encourage educators to explore more ways that Pi-WRF can be used to achieve science standards across middle and high school grade levels.
