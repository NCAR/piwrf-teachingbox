## Pi-WRF and NGSS
<br/>
<img src="assets/ngss_logo.png" align="right" alt="NGSS 3 Dimension Learning">
The Next-Generation Science Standards (NGSS) cover many different science 
disciplines. (More information on NGSS can be found below.) The concepts 
of weather and climate cut across most science disciplines, and Pi-WRF is 
used to teach weather and climate concepts. Therefore, the Pi-WRF team 
uses standards from NGSS to ensure that learners have a firm grasp of 
important science concepts.

The NGSS performance expectations and 3-D learning approach help educators 
teach key science concepts more easily. Therefore, the Pi-WRF team is very 
proud to build the Pi-WRF teaching boxes with these standards in mind. 
By using this NGSS approach, Pi-WRF allows educators the flexibility to 
creatively connect students' interests and life experiences to the 
important concepts of weather forecasting and exploration. It is important 
for both educators and students to understand the complex relationships 
between the weather and climate domains and other science domains. By 
using the Pi-WRF teaching boxes, other Pi-WRF activities, and the NGSS 
learning approach, educators can help students develop a coherent 
understanding of these relationships.

A key feature of the Pi-WRF application is an interface for analyzing 
data, and for integrating different types of data. Some of the types of 
data that Pi-WRF can easily integrate are weather data, climate data, and 
environmental data such as data on greenhouse gas saturation. Teachers can 
make use of the real and ideal weather data provided by Pi-WRF to analyze 
various data and answer scientific questions. However, this is not the 
extent of Pi-WRF's analysis capability; notably, it also contains 
libraries for analysis of tabular data. (Examples of tabular data formats 
are csv, xlsx, and netcdf.) These features of Pi-WRF allow educators to 
easily collect data about different weather-related events, and to analyze 
these data, either independently or in conjunction with weather data.

By using Pi-WRF, educators can introduce students to many concepts of 
weather and climate science, including:

- Weather, including simulation and modeling
- Reading and understanding maps
- Data analysis and visualization
- Communication of scientific findings

### Overview of the Next-Generation Science Standards (NGSS)

The Next-Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are designed to standardize 
expectations for skills and knowledge. Specifically, these standards list 
the skills and knowledgs that K-12 students should be able to apply across 
various science disciplines. NGSS utilizes a research-based approach to 
K-12 science education. This approach allows educators to design more 
creative and engaging learning experiences, and to connect science to the 
individual interests and everyday life of each student. 

NGSS promotes a three-dimensional approach to K-12 science learning, 
called 3-D learning. This approach utilizes intersections between three 
elements of learning: (a) Crosscutting Concepts, (b) Science 
and Engineering Practices, and (c) Disciplinary Core Ideas. These three 
elements, referred to as dimensions (hence the name "3-D learning"), are 
integral components of every standard in NGSS. By using these dimensions 
in science curricula, educators can provide K-12 students with a rich 
understanding of science concepts.

A brief overview of the components (dimensions) of NGSS 3-D learning can 
be found below. For more information, please visit the [NGSS official 
website](https://www.nextgenscience.org).

**Practices:** Components of NGSS described as practices define real-world 
behaviors and engineering techniques. Specifically, only behaviors and 
techniques adopted by way of scientific investigation and theory can be 
listed as NGSS practices. Examples of NGSS practices include 
engineering-based design, scientific inquiry, problem-solving, and 
computational thinking.

**Crosscutting Concepts:** NGSS crosscutting concepts are scientific 
methods and bodies of knowledge that can be applied to any domain of 
science. These concepts can help students develop a coherent and 
scientifically sound view of the world. Examples of these concepts are 
measurement, energy/matter, systems, structure, and function.

**Disciplinary Core Ideas:** NGSS core ideas are science-related content 
elements and activities. In order to be considered NGSS core ideas, these 
elements and activities must have broad implications across various 
scientific fields, and must also be related to students' real-life 
experiences. In addition, NGSS core ideas must meet at least two of these 
four criteria:

1. The idea must have broad importance across multiple science and 
engineering disciplines.
2. The idea must be connected to students' interests and real-life 
experiences.
3. The idea must be able to be taught and learned across multiple grade 
levels, and with increasing depth and breadth.
4. The idea must provide at least one key tool for investigating more 
complex ideas, and/or for solving problems.

Finally, NGSS disciplinary core ideas are grouped into four domains:

- Physical sciences
- Earth and space sciences
- Life sciences
- Engineering, technology, and application of science

The Pi-WRF project focuses of the concept of weather research and 
forecasting, which fits primarily within the Earth and space sciences 
domain. However, it is important to realize that the impacts of weather 
research and forecasting cut across all four domains identified above.

The next sections provide NGSS standards for weather science at the middle 
and high school levels, along with overviews of the NGSS 3-D learning 
approach for each standard, as well as examples of the usage of Pi-WRF in 
teaching these concepts.

> **Note:**

As stated above, the concept and implication of weather science cuts 
across most science disciplines. Therefore, the Pi-WRF team encourages 
middle and high school educators to explore ways that Pi-WRF can be used 
to teach concepts relating to NGSS standards in other fields.
