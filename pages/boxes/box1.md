**Overview**

This teaching box provides an introduction to the Pi-WRF project, with a 
shift towards a community-driven framework. This new framework provides a 
more accessible user interface, simplifying interaction with the weather 
model as well as modification and development of Pi-WRF modules. These 
benefits offered by the new framework are provided by the setup of the 
framework, which connects Jupyter Notebooks to the existing Weather 
Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and runs smoothly on a Raspberry Pi.
