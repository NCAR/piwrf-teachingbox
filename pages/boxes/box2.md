*  **Description:** This teaching box provides a sample lesson on the 
usage of Pi-WRF, including concepts and processes of weather forecasting.
*  **Audience:** middle school, high school, college.
*  **Standards used:** Reading, Writing, MS - ESS2-5, HS - ESS2-4, MS - ESS2-6, HS - ESS3-5.

**Overview**

This teaching box is designed to introduce students to the WRF model, 
including the concepts of weather forecasting and model simulation. 
Learners making use of this teaching box can produce their own weather 
forecasts by running the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. 
Learners can then make use of their WRF model output to answer a question 
that fits their interests. At the end of this teaching box lesson, 
learners will be able to demonstrate the following weather-related 
skills:

1.  Use of weather datasets, along with the WRF model, to answer 
real-world weather-related questions.

2.  Application of practices associated with data science, such as 
understanding, analysis, visualization, and communication of data, to 
compile weather-related narratives (weather stories).

3.  Analysis of, and reflection on, the social impact of weather 
forecasting.
