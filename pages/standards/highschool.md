### High School (9-12) Performance Expectations
This page lists various NGSS standards for high school students. 
Specifically, this page lists standards that can be taught more easily by 
using Pi-WRF. Please note that there may be additional Pi-WRF-compatible 
NGSS standards that are not listed here.


#### 1. HS-ESS2-2 Earth System

<p>It can be scientifically proven that greenhouse gas emissions can 
cause a rise in global temperature. In addition, there is a link 
between average humidity levels and geographical area of wetlands. 
Students must be able to demonstrate an understanding of these 
concepts and their impact. Teachers must also be able to teach these 
concepts and their impact, and ensure that students learn them well. 
This standard emphasizes the need for students and teachers to show 
such an understanding.</p>
<p>By using the Pi-WRF application, teachers can design curricula that 
include measurement of surface temperature data. Teachers and students 
can then compare these data across regions containing varying amounts 
of greenhouse gases. This can allow both teachers and students to 
investigate links between greenhouse gas saturation and surface 
temperature.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th colspan="3"><p><strong>Performance Expectation</strong></p>
<p>Students can analyze geoscience data to help prove geoscientific 
concepts. One such concept is that a single change to Earth's surface 
can create feedback which, in turn, changes other Earth systems.</p>

<td><p><strong>Analyzing and Interpreting Data</strong></p>
<p>Some scientific tasks inherently require analysis of data. 
These tasks include proposition of valid and reliable scientific 
claims, development of optimal design solutions, and many others. 
Data analysis can be performed using many types of tools and 
technologies, as well as computational and mathematical models.</p></td> 
<td><p><strong>ESS2.A: Earth Materials and Systems</strong></p>
<p>Earth systems are inherently dynamic, and inevitably interact with 
one another. Therefore, a change to one Earth system can affect 
others. This, in turn, can trigger feedback effects that may increase 
or decrease the original change.</p> <p><strong>ESS2.D: Weather and 
Climate</strong></p>
<p>Earth's global climate systems are driven in many ways by 
electromagnetic radiation from the Sun. This radiation affects 
many global climate systems, such as the atmosphere, ocean, and 
land. These systems are affected by reflection, absorption, 
storage, and redistribution of solar radiation. In addition, 
solar radiation can be re-radiated into space, which can also 
affect global climate.</p></td> <td><p><strong>Stability and 
Change</strong></p>
<p>Both negative and positive feedback are capable of either 
stabilizing or destabilizing scientific systems.</p>
<p><strong>Influence of Engineering, Technology, and Science on Society and the Natural World</strong></p>
<p>New technologies can have profound impacts on both society and 
the environment. However, many of the impacts of new technology 
are unforeseen and unanticipated. Therefore, cost-benefit 
analysis should always be involved in decisions about technology.</p></td>

#### 2. HS-ESS2-4 Earth Systems
<p>Although human activity is most often blamed for changes in 
climate, it is only one factor accounting for these changes. In 
addition to human activity, some of the factors affecting climate 
include surface temperature, precipitation patterns, and sea levels. 
All of these factors can have differing impacts over many distinct 
time periods of varying length. It is important for students to 
demonstrate an understanding of the many factors that can affect 
climate over different time periods. This standard emphasizes the need 
for students to show such an understanding.</p>
<p>By using the Pi-WRF application, students can conduct scientific 
studies called longitudinal studies. For this standard, these studies 
can be configured to observe and collect data on human activities and 
weather. The Pi-WRF application can then analyze these data and 
provide insight into changes in climate over time periods up to 
several months.</p> <table> <thead> <tr class="header">

<p>Using a single explanation supported by multiple lines of evidence

<p><strong>Developing and Using Models</strong></p>
<p>Scientific modeling concepts learned in grades 9-12 build on concepts 
learned in grades K-8. Modeling concepts learned in high school focus on 
the elements of using, synthesizing, and developing models. There are 
many important relationships between systems and their components. 
Models developed by high school students should be able to predict and 
show these relationships.</p> <p>Use a model to provide mechanistic 
accounts of phenomena.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>ESS2.A: Earth Materials and Systems</strong></p>
<p>The geological record shows that there are many factors that can change 
both global and regional climate. Factors associated with the Earth 
include tectonic events, ocean currents, volcanic activity, glacial and 
vegetation coverage, and human activity. Other factors include changes in 
the Sun's energy output and Earth's orbit. Changes to climate can 
occur on a variety of different time scales. Some changes are sudden, 
such as volcanic ash clouds. Other changes occur on longer time 
scales, such as ice ages. Still other changes occur over very long 
time scales, such as tectonic cycles.</p> <p><strong>ESS2.D: Weather and

<p>Earth's global climate systems are driven in many ways by 
electromagnetic radiation from the Sun. This radiation affects 
many global climate systems, such as the atmosphere, ocean, and

affect global climate.</p></td> <td><p><strong>Cause and 
Effect</strong></p>
<p>Empirical evidence is an important part of scientific 
analysis. It is required in order to distinguish between cause 
and correlation, and to make claims about specific causes and 
effects.</p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

#### 3. HS-ESS3-5: Earth and Human Activity
<p>It is important for students to be able to forecast specific 
climate conditions, most notably conditions that are changing rapidly 
in today's world. These conditions include glacial ice volumes and sea 
levels, among others. Such forecasts make use of models that account 
for variations in location, temperature, and precipitation. This 
standard emphasizes the need for students to be able to make these 
forecasts.</p>
<p>Analysis of data sometimes involves combining multiple types of data. 
In this case, students can use Pi-WRF to combine data about changing 
glacial ice volumes or sea levels with ideal (historic) or real (current) 
weather data. Students can use such combinations of data to examine if 
a relationship exists between the systems measured. For this standard, 
the relationship examined is between changing weather conditions and 
changing glacial ice volumes or sea levels.</p>

<th colspan="3"><p><strong>Performance Expectation</strong></p>
<p>Analyze geoscience data and the results of global climate models. 
Use these data to make an evidence-based forecast of the current rate 
of global or regional climate change. Finally, use the forecast to 
assess associated future impacts to Earth's systems.</p>
