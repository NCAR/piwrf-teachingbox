### High School (9-12) Performance Expectations
Below are some high school NGSS standards that can be addressed using the 
Pi-WRF application. The list is, however, not exhaustive.


#### 1. HS-ESS2-2 Earth System

<p>This standard emphasizes the need for students to understand how the 
increase in greenhouse gases impacts rising global temperatures, as well 
as how the 
loss of wetlands causes a decrease in local humidity. Within this 
performance expectation, teachers are encouraged to make explicit the 
impact of rising temperatures on glacial ice, and to help students 
understand how low humidity results in a decrease in our available 
wetlands.</p>
<p>Using Pi-WRF, teachers can guide students to investigate and compare 
the surface temperature across regions with disparate ranges of 
greenhouse gas saturation.</p>

<table>

<tr class="header">
<th colspan="3"><p><strong>Performance Expectation</strong></p>
<p>Analyze geoscience data to make the claim that one change to Earth’s surface can create feedback that causes changes to other Earth systems.</p>

components.</em></p></th>

<td><p><strong>ESS2.A: Earth Materials and Systems</strong></p>
<p>Earth’s systems, being dynamic and interacting, cause feedback effects that can increase or decrease the original changes.</p>
<p><strong>ESS2.D: Weather and Climate</strong></p>
<p>The foundation for Earth’s global climate systems is the electromagnetic radiation from the sun, as well as its reflection, absorption, storage, and redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and land systems, and this energy’s re-radiation into space.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Stability and Change</strong></p>
<p>Feedback (negative or positive) can stabilize or destabilize a system.</p>
<p><strong>Influence of Engineering, Technology, and Science on Society and the Natural World</strong></p>
<p>New technologies can have deep impacts on society and the environment, including some that were not anticipated. Analysis of costs and benefits is a critical aspect of decisions about technology.</p></td>

#### 2. HS-ESS2-4 Earth Systems
<p>This standard emphasizes the need for students to demonstrate an understanding of how changes in climate are impacted by changing surface temperatures, precipitation patterns, sea levels, and human activities over different periods of time.</p>
<p>Using Pi-WRF, students can investigate changing weather conditions by 
conducting longitudinal studies. These studies can be designed to observe 
and analyze human activities 
and weather data (such as temperature and precipitation) over several 
months.</p>

<th colspan="3"><p><strong>Performance Expectation</strong></p>

<td><p><strong>Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Science arguments are strengthened by multiple lines of evidence supporting a single explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Developing and Using Models</strong></p>
<p>Modeling in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences, and progresses to using, 
synthesizing, and developing models. These models predict and show 
relationships 
among variables between systems and their components in the natural and designed world(s).</p>

<td><p><strong>ESS2.A: Earth Materials and Systems</strong></p>
<p>The geological record shows that changes to global and regional climate 
can be caused by interactions among changes in the sun’s energy output or 
Earth’s orbit, as well as tectonic events, ocean circulation, volcanic 
activity, 
glaciers, vegetation, and human activities. These changes can occur on a 
variety of time scales from sudden (e.g., volcanic ash clouds) to 
intermediate (such as ice ages) to very long-term tectonic cycles.</p>
<p><strong>ESS2.D: Weather and Climate</strong></p>
<p>The foundation for Earth’s global climate systems is the electromagnetic radiation from the sun, as well as its reflection, absorption, storage, and redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and land systems, and this energy’s re-radiation into space.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Cause and Effect</strong></p>
<p>Empirical evidence is required to differentiate between cause and 
correlation, and to make claims about specific causes and 
effects.</p></td> </tr>

#### 3. HS-ESS3-5: Earth and Human Activity
<p>This standard emphasizes the need for students to be able to forecast 
climate conditions, such as glacial ice volumes and sea levels, using 
models that account for variations in location, temperature, and precipitation.</p>
<p>Using Pi-WRF, students can combine data about changing glacial ice 
volumes or sea levels with ideal or real weather data. The students can 
then use these data to test 
and examine if any relationship exists between changing weather conditions and observed changes in glacial ice volumes or sea level.</p>
