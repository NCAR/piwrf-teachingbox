### Middle School (6-8)
#### 1. MS-ESS2-5 Earth’s Systems

This standard emphasizes the need for students to demonstrate an understanding of how weather (defined by temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation, and wind) changes over time due to flow of air masses from regions of high pressure to low pressure. Learners are also expected to understand how weather can be predicted using data from the environment. 

Using Pi-WRF learners can forecast and investigate how weather conditions like temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed changes across different regions and time periods. By integrating other environmental data (such as pressure logs, air quality, and altitude) with weather data and maps, students can investigate the relationship that exists between varying environmental conditions and how changes in one affects the other

#### 2. MS-ESS2-6 Earth’s Systems

This standard emphasizes the need for students to demonstrate an understanding of how weather patterns vary by latitude, altitude, vegetation, and geographic land distribution. Using Pi-WRF students can collect, analyze and visualize weather data across different domains (locations) and compare their results to see how temperature, precipitation and wind speed differ across regions with high or low altitude.

#### 3. MS-ESS3-2. Earth and Human Activity

<p>This standard emphasizes the need for students to demonstrate an understanding of how certain natural hazards such as volcanic eruptions and severe weather , are preceded by phenomena that allow for reliable predictions, but others, such as earthquakes, occur suddenly and with no notice, and thus are not yet predictable.</p>
<p>Using Pi-WRF learners can analyze historical (ideal) data and use them to predict the likelihood that a particular severe weather condition will occur. For example, educators can engage their students in an analysis of weather conditions that preceded past severe weather events (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods) and use their analysis to model the features (locations, magnitudes, and frequencies) and possibility of a similar event.</p>

<p>The uses of technologies and any limitations on their use are driven by individual or societal needs, desires, and values; by the findings of scientific research; and by differences in such factors as climate, natural resources, and economic conditions. Thus technology use varies from region to region and over time.</p></td>

#### 4. MS-ESS3-5 Earth and Human Activity

<p>This standard emphasizes the need for students to understand the impact human activities (such as fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and agricultural activity) has on the rise of global and regional temperature.</p>
<p>Using Pi-WRF students can investigate temperature differences across various domains with differing and distinct activities. For example, students collect and analyze weather data for oil producing states and compare them with states with little or no fossil fuel production. Students could also collect data about industrial and agricultural activities in a location of interest and investigate whether a correlation exists between rising temperatures at this location and human activities.</p>

<p>Human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth’s mean surface temperature (global warming). Reducing the level of climate change and reducing human vulnerability to whatever climate changes do occur depend on the understanding of climate science, engineering capabilities, and other kinds of knowledge, such as understanding of human behavior and on applying that knowledge wisely in decisions and activities.</p></td>
