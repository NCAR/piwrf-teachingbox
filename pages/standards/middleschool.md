### Middle School (6-8) Performance Expectations
Below are some middle school NGSS standards that can be addressed using 
the Pi-WRF application. The list is, however, not exhaustive.

#### 1. MS-ESS2-5 Earth’s Systems

This standard emphasizes the need for students to demonstrate an 
understanding of how weather changes over time. (For this standard, 
"weather" is defined by 
temperature, pressure, 
humidity, precipitation, and wind.) Weather changes over time due to flow 
of air 
masses from regions of high pressure to low pressure. In addition, 
learners are also 
expected to understand how weather can be predicted using data from the environment. 

Using Pi-WRF, learners can forecast and investigate how weather 
conditions, 
such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed, change 
across 
different regions and time periods. Students can also use Pi-WRF to 
investigate relationships between many disparate environmental conditions, 
and how changes in one can affect others. This can be performed by 
integrating other environmental 
data (such as pressure logs, air quality, and altitude) with weather data 
and maps.

#### 2. MS-ESS2-6 Earth’s Systems

This standard emphasizes the need for students to demonstrate an 
understanding of variance in weather patterns. This variance can be caused 
by variations in latitude and altitude, 
as well as geographic land distribution, and the vegetation 
coverage on that land. Using Pi-WRF, students can 
collect, analyze and visualize weather data across different domains 
(locations). These data can then be compared to other students' data or to 
actual weather data. By doing so, students can see how temperature, 
precipitation, 
and wind speed differ across regions with disparate altitude levels.

<p><strong>ESS2.D: Weather and Climate</strong></p>

#### 3. MS-ESS3-2. Earth and Human Activity

<p>This standard emphasizes the need for students to demonstrate an 
understanding of predictability, or unpredictability, of certain natural 
hazards. Some natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and 
severe weather, are preceded by phenomena that allow for reliable 
predictions, and thus are easily predictable. However, there are other 
natural hazards, such as earthquakes, 
that occur suddenly and with no notice, and thus are not yet 
predictable.</p>
<p>Using Pi-WRF, learners can analyze historical (ideal) data, and use 
them 
to predict the likelihood of particular severe weather, such as a 
tornado. For example, educators can engage their students to analyze 
weather conditions that preceded past severe weather events (such as 
hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). This analysis can then be used to 
model the features of the event (such as locations, 
magnitudes, and frequencies), as well as the possibility of a similar 
event.</p>

<p>All human activity draws on natural resources, and has both short- and 
long-term consequences, positive and negative, for the health of people 
and the natural environment.</p>
<p>The uses of technologies and any limitations on their use are driven by 
individual or societal needs, desires, and values; by the findings of 
scientific research; and by differences in factors such as climate, 
natural 
resources, and economic conditions. Thus, technology use varies from 
region to region, as well as over time.</p></td>

#### 4. MS-ESS3-5 Earth and Human Activity

<p>This standard emphasizes the need for students to understand the impact 
of anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. 
By collecting data on anthropogenic climate change, students can learn 
how many typical human activities (such as fossil fuel combustion, cement 
production, and 
agricultural activity) can lead to a rise in global and regional 
temperature.</p>
<p>Using Pi-WRF, students can collect climate change data by investigating 
temperature differences across 
various domains with differing and distinct activities. For example, 
students can collect and analyze weather and temperature data for oil 
producing states, and then
compare these data with similar data on states with little or no fossil 
fuel production. 
Students could also collect data about industrial and agricultural 
activities in a location of interest, and investigate whether a correlation exists between rising temperatures at this location and human activities.</p>

<td><p><strong>ESS3.D: Global Climate Change</strong></p>
<p>Human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning 
fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth’s mean 
surface temperature (global warming). Understanding of climate science, 
engineering capabilities, and human behavior, along with other similar 
knowledge, can help with planning decisions and activities that reduce 
this climate change and its impact.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Stability and Change</strong></p>
<p>Stability of a scientific system might be disturbed, either by sudden 
events, or by gradual changes that accumulate over time.</p>
