### Middle School (6-8) Performance Expectations
This page lists various NGSS standards for middle school students. 
Specifically, this page lists standards that can be taught more easily by 
using Pi-WRF. Please note that there may be additional Pi-WRF-compatible 
NGSS standards that are not listed here.

#### 1. MS-ESS2-5 Earth’s Systems

There are many elements that define weather, such as temperature, 
pressure, humidity, precipitation, and wind. Climate is the change in 
these elements over time. It is important for students to be able to 
demonstrate an understanding of weather and climate. This standard 
emphasizes the need for students to show such an understanding. It is 
important for learners to understand that changes in weather are caused by 
flow of air masses. Atmospheric air masses naturally flow from regions of 
high air pressure to regions of low air pressure. Learners are also 
expected to understand that data from the environment allow weather to be 
predicted.

Weather conditions (such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind 
speed) can change across different regions as well as time periods (in 
other words, across space and time). By using Pi-WRF, learners can 
investigate and better understand changes in weather, and can also learn 
how to forecast weather. Students can also use Pi-WRF to 
investigate relationships between many disparate environmental conditions, 
and how changes in one can affect others. This can be performed by 
integrating other environmental 
data (such as pressure logs, air quality, and altitude) with weather data 
and maps.

such as winds, landforms, ocean temperature, and ocean currents.</p>

#### 2. MS-ESS2-6 Earth’s Systems

Variance in weather patterns can be caused by many factors, including 
variations in latitude or altitude, geographic land distribution, and 
vegetation coverage. It is important for students to be able to 
demonstrate an understanding of weather pattern variance. This standard 
emphasizes the need for students to show such an understanding. By using 
the Pi-WRF application, students can collect, analyze, and visualize 
weather data across different domains (locations). Students can compare 
weather data with other students' weather data (in a single classroom, for 
example), or compare their weather data against weather data gathered by 
professional meteorologists. By comparing weather data in this way, 
students can gain a better understanding of how factors such as 
temperature, precipitation, and wind speed can vary across latitudes and 
altitudes.

<p>There are many factors that determine climate, but one of the main 
factors is the global patterns of interconnected ocean currents. These 
currents are driven by variations in density, which are in turn caused 
by ocean temperature and salinity.</p>

<p><strong>ESS2.D: Weather and Climate</strong></p>
<p>Weather and climate are influenced by many interactions involving many 
Earth science systems. These systems include sunlight, the ocean, the 
atmosphere, ice, landforms, and living things. There are many 
factors that affect these interactions, such as latitude, 
altitude, local geography, and regional geography. All of these 
elements can affect oceanic and atmospheric flow patterns.</p></td>

#### 3. MS-ESS3-2. Earth and Human Activity

<p>Natural disasters are among the most important Earth science events 
to be able to predict. However, the predictability of types of natural 
disasters varies greatly. For example, volcanic eruptions and severe 
weather are preceded by phenomena that can be scientifically detected, 
making these natural disasters easy to predict. Other natural 
disasters, such as earthquakes, cannot be scientifically detected far 
enough ahead of time with current equipment, and thus are not yet 
predictable. It is important for students to demonstrate an 
understanding of variations in predictability of natural disasters. 
This standard emphasizes the need for students to show such an 
understanding.</p>
<p>By using the Pi-WRF application, learners can analyze historical 
(ideal) data on a particular severe weather event, such as tornadoes, 
and use the data to predict the possibility of the event reoccurring 
in a given time frame. Educators can also use Pi-WRF to develop 
lessons on weather conditions that precede severe weather. By 
analyzing these conditions, students and educators can predict the 
possibility of a severe weather event, such as a hurricane, tornado, 
or flood. Data on such weather conditions can also be used to model 
the features of a severe weather event, such as location, magnitude, 
and frequency.</p>

forecasts include the history of natural disasters in the region, as well 
as related geological forces and an understanding of such forces. 
(MS-ESS3-2)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Patterns</strong></p>
<p>Patterns in scientific data are not always obvious. The use of graphs, 
charts, and images can help identify these patterns. (MS-ESS3-2)</p>
<p><strong>Influence of Science, Engineering, and Technology on Society and the Natural World</strong></p>
<p>All human activity makes use of natural resources. This can have 
many effects of the health of humans as well as the natural 
environment. Furthermore, these effects can be either short-term or 
long-term, and either positive or negative.</p>
<p>There are many different scientific uses of technology. There 
are also many restrictions placed on such technology use, such as 
political or economic restrictions. There are many driving 
factors for both of these elements, including:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Individual or societal needs, desires, and values</li>
<li>Findings of scientific research</li>
<li>Differences in climate and natural resources</li>
<li>Differences in economic conditions</li>
</ul>
Thus, the use of technology for science can vary over 
geographical and political regions as well as over time.</p></td> </tr>

#### 4. MS-ESS3-5 Earth and Human Activity

<p>One of the most important issues in today's world is the issue of 
anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. Many typical human 
activities, such as fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and 
agricultural activity, contribute to this climate change. It is 
important for students to demonstrate an understanding of the link 
between human activities and increases in global and regional 
temperature. This standard emphasizes the need for students to show 
such an understanding.</p>
<p>By using the Pi-WRF application, students can collect many types of 
data on climate change. Most importantly, students can collect data on 
temperature differences across various locations with differing and 
distinct activities. For example, fossil fuel combustion is one of the 
main causes of anthropogenic climate change. Pi-WRF can assist students in 
scientifically proving this for themselves. First, students can compare 
data from oil-producing and coal-mining states with data from states with 
little or no fossil fuel production. However, it is important for 
students to learn that complex scientific concepts, such as climate 
change, have many elements, and thus require collection of many types 
of data. For example, by using Pi-WRF, students can collect data on 
industrial and agricultural activity in a given location. Students can 
then use these data to investigate whether a correlation exists 
between specific human activity and rising temperatures in that 
location.</p>

<p>Scientific data prove that there is currently a dramatic rise in 
Earth's mean surface temperature. This global warming is caused primarily 
by human activities. Many human activities contribute to global warming, 
but the most important is the burning of fossil fuels, which releases 
greenhouse gases. There are many decisions and activities that 
can reduce global warming and its impact, but most require 
specialized knowledge. This knowledge includes, among other 
things, understanding of climate science, engineering 
capabilities, and human behavior.</p></td> <td><p><strong>Stability and 
Change</strong></p>
