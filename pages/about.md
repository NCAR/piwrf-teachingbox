## About The Project
The goal of this project is to develop educational modules and build a framework to facilitate further community contributed modules involving running a real weather model on a Raspberry Pi to make a weather forecast. This page hosts teaching modules called PiWRF Teaching Boxes that contain a series of interactive lessons centered around running the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model on a raspberry-Pi. Users can run this software on a raspberry Pi or on their own machine.

Our goal is to facilitate a community of instructors, teachers, and faculty to create a community library of teaching boxes. This will bring the best and most creative ideas of teachers, students, and faculty from accross the world who are interested in sharing teaching tools. This site is moderated by NCAR and we will be adding modules from introductory how to set up a raspberryPi and run Pi-WRF, how to use a jupyter notebook, to short teaching boxes on meteorological concepts and computing principles such as what is parrallel computing. We would like to invite you to use these teaching boxes in your classroom, download it and modify it to create your own case studies and teaching concepts. Then share your teaching box with us so that we can include it on this website to make this a truly community driven educational resource.

We are happy to be part of the 2021 HPE Exascale day on October 18th which celebrates the world of supercomputing and large scale data. Weather forecasting and modeling with tools such as WRF is a classic challenge that has faced the world of high performance computing since its inception.
