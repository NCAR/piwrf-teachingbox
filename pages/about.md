## About The Project
The goal of this project is to develop educational modules and build a 
framework to facilitate further community contributed modules. These 
modules involve weather forecasting by 
running an advanced weather model on a Raspberry Pi. This page hosts 
teaching modules, known as Pi-WRF teaching boxes, that contain a series of 
interactive lessons. The core of these lessons is the production of 
forecasts by running the Weather Research and 
Forecasting 
(WRF) model on a Raspberry Pi. Users can run this software on a Raspberry 
Pi or on their own machine.

Our goal is to facilitate a community of instructors, teachers, and 
faculty, and for that community to create a library of 
teaching boxes that will benefit multiple scientific communities. 
This will help facilitate the sharing of teaching tools and creative ideas 
between teachers, students, and faculty from around the world.
This site 
is moderated by NCAR and we will be adding modules ranging from 
introductory to advanced. Some of the topics covered in these modules 
include: 
  - How to set up a Raspberry Pi and run Pi-WRF
  - How to use Jupyter notebooks 
  - Meteorological concepts
  - Computing principles such as parallel computing at exascale

We would like to invite you to use these teaching boxes in your classroom; 
you can also 
download them and modify them to create your own case studies and teaching 
concepts. Once you have created your own version of a teaching box, please 
share it with us so that we can include it on 
this website. This helps create truly community driven educational 
resources.

We are happy to have been a part of the [2021 HPE Exascale day on October 
18th](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/discover-more-network/events/exascale.html), 
which celebrates the world of supercomputing and large-scale data. Weather 
forecasting and modeling with tools such as WRF is a classic challenge 
that has faced the world of high-performance computing since its 
inception.
