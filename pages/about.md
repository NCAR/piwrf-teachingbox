## About The Project
The overall goal of the Pi-WRF project is to develop educational modules 
(teaching boxes), and to build a framework for community contribution of 
further modules. These modules are designed to teach weather concepts, 
including forecasting. The Pi-WRF software enables this by allowing 
learners to run an advanced weather model on a Raspberry Pi. As the 
official website for the Pi-WRF project, this website contains the Pi-WRF 
teaching boxes; each one of these teaching boxes contains a series of 
interactive lessons. All of these lessons have one thing in common; they 
all involve using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to 
create forecasts. These lessons were specifically designed to run on a 
Raspberry Pi; however, users can run the Pi-WRF software on a laptop or 
desktop as well.

The Pi-WRF project also aims to create and facilitate a community of 
instructors, teachers, and faculty. This community will then create Pi-WRF 
teaching boxes covering a broad range of topics that will benefit multiple 
scientific communities.
Teachers, students, and faculty from all across the globe can much more 
easily share teaching tools and creative ideas through Pi-WRF teaching 
boxes. This website is moderated by NCAR; in addition, NCAR staff will add 
an initial offering of teaching boxes, with lessons ranging from 
introductory to advanced. Some of the topics covered in these modules 
include: 
  - How to set up a Raspberry Pi and run Pi-WRF
  - How to use Jupyter notebooks 
  - Meteorological concepts
  - Computing principles such as parallel computing at exascale

The Pi-WRF team is pleased to invite you to use Pi-WRF teaching boxes in 
your classroom, and to download the teaching box materials. In addition, 
after downloading a teaching box, you can create your own case studies and 
teaching concepts by modifying it. The Pi-WRF team is also interested in 
submissions of modified teaching boxes. If you modify an existing teaching 
box, please submit it to the Pi-WRF team for inclusion on this website. 
By accepting both original and modified teaching boxes, the Pi-WRF project 
creates educational resources that are more in line with its 
community-driven model.

The Pi-WRF team also wishes to acknowledge the high-performance computing 
community for its work with the WRF model. The use of weather models (such 
as WRF) for weather forecasting and modeling has been a perennial 
challenge for the high-performance computing community. As such, we are 
happy to have been a part of the [2021 HPE Exascale day on October 
18th](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/discover-more-network/events/exascale.html), 
which celebrates supercomputing and the use of large-scale data.
