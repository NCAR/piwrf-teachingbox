# About Teaching Boxes
The goal of this project is to run a real weather model on your Raspberry Pi and make a weather forecast. This page presents a series of teaching modules developed by the community of student, teachers, university faculty, and NCAR staff to bring advance weather modeling to your desktop. You will choose when to run the simulation, you will choose the location, you will visualize the model's output, and you will make a forecast. By working through these modules, you will learn some of the steps in running a weather model, how to interpret a weather map, and how to determine the accuracy of a weather forecast.
