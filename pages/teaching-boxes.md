# About Teaching Boxes
The goal of this project is to run a real weather model on your Raspberry 
Pi, and to produce a forecast using this model. This page presents a 
series of 
teaching 
modules developed by a community of students, teachers, university 
faculty, 
and NCAR staff, in order to bring advanced weather modeling to your 
desktop. You 
will choose when to run the simulation, you will choose the location, you 
will visualize the model's output, and you will make a forecast. By 
working through these modules, you will learn some of the steps in running 
a weather model, including how to interpret a weather map and how to 
determine the accuracy of a weather forecast.
