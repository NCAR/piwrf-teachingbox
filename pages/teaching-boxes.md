# About Teaching Boxes
The Pi-WRF teaching box project aims to improve Earth science education. 
The project makes use of the Pi-WRF software, which allows Raspberry Pi 
users to run a real weather model, including weather forecasting. This 
section of the project's webpage contains teaching boxes, which are 
starting points for the development of Pi-WRF teaching modules. These 
teaching boxes are created by a community made up of students, teachers, 
university faculty, and NCAR staff. Pi-WRF teaching boxes and modules can 
transform a relatively small location, such as a desktop, into a gateway 
to learning advanced weather modeling concepts. With Pi-WRF, you can make 
a weather forecast that you have total control over, including time, 
location, and how to visualize the output. Pi-WRF teaching boxes and 
modules are also an excellent learning tool. One of the key concepts that 
Pi-WRF can teach is the sequence of steps involved in running a weather 
model; this includes interpreting weather maps and quantifying accuracy of 
weather forecasts.
