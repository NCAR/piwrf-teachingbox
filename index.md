banner-description: Pi-WRF Teaching Boxes provide resources for 
development of Pi-WRF teaching modules. Through these modules, coupled 
with the Pi-WRF software, educators can improve the quality of their 
middle school and high school Earth science curricula. In addition, 
university faculty and students can build new Pi-WRF modules with more 
advanced learning concepts, and can make changes to the weather model used 
by the Pi-WRF software.
